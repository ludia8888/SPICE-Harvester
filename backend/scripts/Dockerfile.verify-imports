# Example: How to add import verification to Dockerfile
# Add this to your service Dockerfile after installing dependencies

# Example for BFF service:
# After pip install -r requirements.txt, add:

# Verify imports at build time
COPY scripts/verify-imports.py /tmp/verify-imports.py
RUN python /tmp/verify-imports.py bff || \
    (echo "‚ùå Import verification failed! Check for missing dependencies." && exit 1)

# For other services, replace 'bff' with the service name:
# - oms
# - instance_worker
# - ontology_worker
# - message_relay
# - projection_worker

# This ensures that any missing dependencies are caught during
# Docker build, not at runtime.
