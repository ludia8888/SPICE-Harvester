## Architectural Principles

The architecture of SPICE HARVESTER is guided by modern software engineering principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.

### 1. Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- **Service Boundaries**: The system is divided into distinct services (BFF, OMS, Funnel), each responsible for a specific business domain
- **Rich Domain Models**: Business logic is encapsulated in rich domain models with value objects for immutable data representation
- **Clear Responsibilities**: Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility (OMS handles core data logic, while BFF handles client-facing interactions)

### 2. Separation of Concerns
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via well-defined REST APIs, allowing them to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently
- **Code Reusability (DRY)**: Common functionalities are centralized in a `shared` library (Service Factory) to avoid code duplication
- **Single Source of Truth**: OMS is the ultimate authority for all core ontology data and its version history

### 3. Enterprise-Grade Patterns
- **Service Factory Pattern**: Centralized FastAPI app creation eliminating 600+ lines of boilerplate code
- **SOLID Principles**: Comprehensive dependency injection, single responsibility, and modular design
- **API Response Standardization**: Unified `{success, message, data}` format across all endpoints
