# SPICE HARVESTER - System Architecture

## 1. Guiding Principles

The architecture of SPICE HARVESTER is guided by modern software engineering principles to ensure scalability, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.

- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The system is divided into distinct services (BFF, OMS, Funnel), each responsible for a specific business domain.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each service has a single, well-defined responsibility. For example, OMS handles core data logic, while the BFF handles client-facing interactions.
- **Loose Coupling**: Services communicate via well-defined REST APIs, allowing them to be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- **Code Reusability (DRY)**: Common functionalities, such as service creation and configuration, are centralized in a `shared` library (e.g., `Service Factory`) to avoid code duplication.
- **Single Source of Truth**: OMS is the ultimate authority for all core ontology data and its version history, preventing data inconsistencies.

## 3. Service Breakdown

### 3.1. BFF (Backend for Frontend)

- **Port**: `8002`
- **Primary Responsibility**: To act as an **Adapter** and **Aggregator** for client applications. It simplifies the backend complexity and provides a user-friendly API.
- **Key Functions**:
    - **Label-to-ID Translation**: Translates human-readable, multi-language labels (e.g., "Ï†úÌíà") into internal system IDs (e.g., `Product`) before calling other services.
    - **Request Orchestration**: Combines multiple calls to OMS and Funnel into a single, efficient client request.
    - **Response Formatting**: Transforms raw data from backend services into a consistent, localized, and easy-to-consume format for the UI.
    - **Merge Conflict Resolution**: Provides high-level APIs to simulate merges, detect conflicts, and orchestrate their resolution.

### 3.2. OMS (Ontology Management Service)

- **Port**: `8000`
- **Primary Responsibility**: The **core engine and single source of truth** for all ontology data, schemas, and versioning. It enforces data integrity and manages the entire data lifecycle.
- **Key Functions**:
    - **Core Business Logic**: Handles all ontology CRUD operations, including the creation of unique IDs from labels.
    - **Git-like Version Control**: Implements the full suite of versioning features (branch, commit, diff, merge, rollback) by interfacing directly with TerminusDB.
    - **Data Integrity and Validation**: Performs all critical data validations, such as circular reference detection and cardinality enforcement.
    - **Direct TerminusDB Interface**: It is the only service that communicates directly with TerminusDB, ensuring a single, controlled access point to the data layer.

### 3.3. Funnel Service

- **Port**: `8004` (corrected)
- **Primary Responsibility**: A specialized, AI-powered service for analyzing external data and bootstrapping ontology schemas.
- **Key Functions**:
    - **Advanced Type Inference**: 1,048 lines of sophisticated algorithms using fuzzy matching, adaptive thresholds, and statistical analysis
    - **Multilingual Support**: Korean (Ïù¥Î©îÏùº, Ï†ÑÌôîÎ≤àÌò∏), Japanese („É°„Éº„É´, ÈõªË©±), Chinese pattern recognition
    - **18+ Data Types**: Comprehensive validation for EMAIL, PHONE, URL, MONEY, COORDINATE, ADDRESS, etc.
    - **Contextual Analysis**: Surrounding column analysis for enhanced accuracy
    - **Data Profiling**: Statistical distribution analysis with confidence scoring
    - **Schema Suggestion**: Generates complete, OMS-compatible ontology schemas
    - **Google Sheets Integration**: Full implementation with Google Sheets API v4

### 3.4. TerminusDB

- **Port**: `6364` (corrected)
- **Primary Responsibility**: The underlying data store and versioning engine for the platform.
- **Key Features Utilized**:
    - **Graph Database**: Stores ontologies and their relationships as a graph, enabling efficient traversal and complex queries.
    - **Complete Git Features**: 7/7 git features implemented and working (branching, commits, diff, merge, PR, rollback, history)
    - **3-Stage Diff**: Commit-based, schema-level, and property-level comparison
    - **Rebase-based Merging**: Advanced conflict-aware merging using TerminusDB's native rebase API
    - **NDJSON API**: Advanced response parsing for complex git operations
    - **Schema-First Approach**: Enforces data consistency and validation at the database level.

## 4. Communication Flow Example: Creating a New Ontology

1.  **Client to BFF**: The frontend sends a `POST` request to the BFF's `/ontology` endpoint. The request body contains user-friendly, multi-language labels (e.g., `{"label": {"ko": "Ï†úÌíà", "en": "Product"}}`).

2.  **BFF (Adapter Role)**:
    - The BFF receives the request.
    - It calls the OMS, forwarding the label-based data. It does **not** create the ID itself.

3.  **BFF to OMS**: The BFF sends a `POST` request to the OMS's `/ontology/create` endpoint, passing the original, label-based data.

4.  **OMS (Core Logic Role)**:
    - The OMS receives the request.
    - **It generates a unique, system-compatible ID** (e.g., `Product`) from the provided label.
    - It performs advanced validation (e.g., checking for circular references).
    - It communicates with TerminusDB to create the new ontology class and its properties.
    - It stores the mapping between the new ID and its labels.

5.  **Response Propagation**:
    - TerminusDB confirms the creation to OMS.
    - OMS returns a standardized `ApiResponse` to the BFF, containing the newly created object with its ID.
    - The BFF receives the structured response and forwards it directly to the client, ensuring a consistent API contract.

## 5. Recent Architectural Improvements (July 2025)
